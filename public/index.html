        <p>
          I have been using computers for as long as I can remember. I started out playing games on Commodores 64 and 128, wrote my first homework assignment 
          on an Amiga 2000, and created my first website on a off-brand PC with Intel 386 chip.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was often considered the family and friends technician, repairing computers in the evening/weekends. I have built a few custom gaming machines over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, I am more focused on the software side of things. As a reliability and production engineer at Morgan Stanley, I work to ensure the 
          securities lending platform remains operational at all times. This involves writing scripts to automate repetative tasks, perform 
          incident/problem management to ensure issues don't reoccur, and support the business by answering questions and resolving one-off issues.
