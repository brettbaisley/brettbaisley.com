    <section>
        <p>I have been using computers for as long as I can remember. Played games on a Commodore 64/128, wrote my first homework assignment on an Amiga 2000, 
         and created my first website on a no-name PC with Intel 386 chip.</p>
         <p>I was the family and friends technician, repairing computers in the evening/weekends. I have built a few custom gaming machines over the years.</p>
         <p>These days, I am more focused on the software side of things.</p>
